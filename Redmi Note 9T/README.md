# Redmi Note 9T - 5G SA Network Connectivity Guide

This guide provides steps to ensure your Redmi Note 9T can connect to a 5G n79 network using Standalone (SA) mode.

## Objective
The ultimate goal is to configure the Redmi Note 9T to connect to a 5G SA network, specifically the n79 band. Follow these steps to check if your device is already able to connect, and if not, configure it accordingly.

## Step 1: Check if the Phone Connects to 5G

When you receive the Redmi Note 9T, the first step is to check if it is already able to connect to a 5G network:

1. Open **Settings** (設定).
2. Open **Dual SIM & Mobile Networks** (雙卡與行動網路).
3. Select the inserted SIM card.
4. In **Preferred Network Type** (網路類型選擇), select **5G Preferred** (5G網路優先).
5. Go back to **Settings** -> **Dual SIM & Mobile Networks** (設定 -> 雙卡與行動網路).
6. Open **Advanced Settings** (進階設定).
7. Enable the option **Enable SA Network** (啟用SA網路).

After performing these steps, check if the device can connect to the 5G SA network.

## Step 2: Enabling SA Mode Manually (If the Option is Missing)

If the **Enable SA Network** (啟用SA網路) option is not visible under **Settings** -> **Dual SIM & Mobile Networks** -> **Advanced Settings**, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Phone** app and go to the dial pad.
2. On the dial pad, input the following code: `*#*#726633#*#*`.
3. A notification should appear with the message **Show 5G network mode selection**.
4. Go back to **Settings** -> **Dual SIM & Mobile Networks** (設定 -> 雙卡與行動網路).
5. Open **Advanced Settings** (進階設定) and enable the option **Enable SA Network** (啟用SA網路).

After enabling the option, check if the phone can now connect to the 5G SA network.

## Step 3: Resetting Secret Mode Control (If You Receive a Different Notification)

If after dialing `*#*#726633#*#*`, the notification reads **Clear 5G network mode / Secret mode control**, follow these steps:

1. Re-enter the same code `*#*#726633#*#*` on the dial pad.
2. A notification should now appear with the message **Show 5G network mode selection**.
3. Return to **Settings** -> **Dual SIM & Mobile Networks** (設定 -> 雙卡與行動網路).
4. Go to **Advanced Settings** (進階設定) and enable the option **Enable SA Network** (啟用SA網路).

Check again if the device can connect to the 5G SA network.

## Step 4: Further Steps (If Still Unable to Connect)

If all the above methods are completed successfully but the phone still cannot connect to the 5G SA network, or if the steps cannot be performed, you can refer to the following steps (to be provided later).
